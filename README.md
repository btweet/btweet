BTweet is a small command line tool that allows you to configure your own twitter bot in a simple way to stream twitter 
based on a list of words. The bot is able to retweet, like and follow users based on the content of 
tweets and various customizable filters.
The [@jazzmaniatico](https://twitter.com/jazzmaniatico) account is an example of possible use for this tool, 
in which it has been configured to search for twitter giveaways.
